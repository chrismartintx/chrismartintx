Hey there, I'm Chris Martin from Round Rock, Texas.  It's been quite the ride in the tech world for me, all starting with that first 8088 computer my dad brought home. I'm really into both the nitty-gritty of web development and the broader scope of networking, automation, and setting up my own homelab projects. Swing by my website for more.
