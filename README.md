👋 Hey there, I'm Chris Martin from [Round Rock, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Rock,_Texas).  

👨‍💻 It's been quite the ride in the tech world for me, all starting with that [first 8088 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) my dad brought home.

🏢 Professionally, I'm really into both the nitty-gritty of web development and the broader scope of networking, and automation.

🏡 At home, I play with all of the expected homelab, [self-hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted), and [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) projects.  [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), you name it...

💻 Groing up I was a [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS)/[Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1) kid.   I used Macs plenty too, but they did not became my daily until somewhere around [macOS Sierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sierra).  I distro hopped back in the day, but I stick to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)-based [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) these days.  Professionally, I am in a Microsoft shop.
